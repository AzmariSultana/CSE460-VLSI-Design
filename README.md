# CSE460-VLSI-Design

# Course Objectives

1. The objectives of this course are to give a brief introduction to the complete process of chip designing

2. provide background knowledge to design, simulate and implement combinational & sequential CMOS circuits

3. teach theoretical concepts to critically analyze the cost & performance of an IC

4. expose the students to the fabrication process & physical design aspects of CMOS IC design

5. introduce the necessary programming language/softwares such as: Verilog (programming language), Quartus II, Microwind & DSCH2 to design, simulate, visualize and verify CMOS logic circuits and layouts
